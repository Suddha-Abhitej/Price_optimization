# Competitive Pricing Analysis and Dynamic Pricing Strategy

This project analyzes competitive pricing data and implements a dynamic pricing strategy to optimize sales revenue. 

## Project Overview

This project uses historical sales data and competitor pricing information to understand the relationship between price, competitor pricing, and sales performance. It then develops a dynamic pricing model that adjusts prices based on market conditions and competitor behavior to maximize revenue.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Analysis:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the distribution of prices, sales, and customer behavior.
* **Price Elasticity Calculation:** Price elasticity of demand is calculated to measure the sensitivity of sales to price changes.
* **Competitive Pricing Analysis:** Competitor pricing is compared to our own pricing to identify opportunities and threats.
* **Dynamic Pricing Strategy:** A dynamic pricing model is developed to adjust prices in response to market dynamics and competitor actions.
* **Sales Forecasting:** Future sales are forecasted under different pricing scenarios to evaluate the impact of dynamic pricing.

## Data

The project uses a dataset named `Competition_Data.csv` containing historical sales data, pricing information, and competitor pricing data.

**Data Columns:**

* **Fiscal_Week_ID:** Week of the fiscal year.
* **Sales_Amount:** Total sales amount for the week.
* **Item_Quantity:** Quantity of items sold during the week.
* **Price:** Price of the item.
* **Competition_Price:** Price of the competitor's item.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** The dataset is loaded and cleaned, handling missing values and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Data visualization techniques are used to explore the relationships between price, competitor pricing, and sales.
3. **Price Elasticity Calculation:** Price elasticity of demand is calculated using percentage changes in price and quantity.
4. **Dynamic Pricing Strategy:** A dynamic pricing model is developed based on price elasticity and competitive pricing analysis.
5. **Sales Forecasting:** Future sales are forecasted under different pricing scenarios using the dynamic pricing model.

## Results

The project demonstrates the potential of dynamic pricing to increase sales revenue. By adjusting prices in response to market conditions and competitor behavior, businesses can capture more market share and improve profitability.

## Future Work

* **Real-time Pricing Updates:** Implement real-time pricing updates based on market data feeds.
* **A/B Testing:** Conduct A/B testing to compare the performance of different pricing strategies.
* **Machine Learning Integration:** Incorporate machine learning algorithms to refine pricing decisions.
